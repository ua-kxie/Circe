Page - elements/widget layout which may contain a viewport
    Viewport - impl iced canvas, grid, panning, fit view etc
        Schematic - impl schematic functions - selection, cycle, move, copy etc over generic elements
            Content - concrete types implmenting specialized functions (Circuit, DeviceDesigner)
        DataGraph - impl plot functions - horz/vert markers, etc.
            Plot - concrete types containing data

Content <-> Page communication - how to do this?
Content/Plot is a member of Page
Viewport gets a reference

add another layer
viewport <-> schematic/plot <-> content
viewport: zoom, pan, etc.
schematic: translate, copy, delete generic selected
plot: data plots
content: concrete elements which can be selected or moved

Viewport:
    CompositeMsg {
        viewport Msg
        content Msg (schematic msg)
    }

schematic:
    enum EventMsg {
        Event
        ContentMsg
        SchematicMsg
    }
    fn update {
        match eventmsg {
            EventMsg::Event(event) => {
                match event {
                    bla bla => {
                        bla bla
                    }
                    _ => {
                        schematic_msg = content.update()
                        self.process_msg(Schematic_msg);
                    }
                }
            }
            EventMsg::ContentMsg(msg) => {
                schematic_msg = content.update(msg)
                self.process_msg(schematic_msg)
            }
            EventMsg::SchematicMsg(msg) => {
                self.process_msg(Schematic_msg);
            }
        }
    }

circuit

schematic lvl: either self msg, or pass to content and process results

Wiring Pathfinder

https://docs.rs/pathfinding/latest/pathfinding/directed/astar/fn.astar.html

build a graph from bounding box of circuit, plus border to allow connects around outside
add all vertical/horizontal paths of all lengths to graph
do not add nodes occupied by devices, net labels, existing nets
run Pathfinder
profit???

build a graph from bounding box of net start, current cursor pos
add all vertical/horizontal paths of all lengths, excluding obstacles
run Pathfinder
increase bounding box size and rerun if fail


=====================================================================

Circuit/DeviceDesigner
    - Schematic as component
    - Viewport as component (later if ever)

selected
get delete event
perform callback to mutate parent

selected
get copy/move event
perform callback to mutate parent

callbacks:
delete element
place element (move if exists, place new if not)
select by intersection
select by contains

 -- lots of problems setting up the callbacks with lifetime and whatnot

 schematic just keep tabs on tentatives/selected
 delete: circuit get selected elements, deletes them
 place: circuit pass curpos to schematic, get selected elements, place/copy/move elements

-- downside is that some logic will still be repeated in circuit/designer e.g. place/copy/move

selected
