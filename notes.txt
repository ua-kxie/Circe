todo:

grab move keep connections:
 - every selected vertex (A) is kept with transformation
 - every non selected vertex (C) is kept without transformation
 - for every selected vertex, down every connection, find first connected, non-selected node with more than 2 connections (B)
 - delete edges between A-B
 - run pathfinding from A to Net(B) (multiple goals per start)

 - nets graph rework: put a net at every floating port (vertex, fixes devices with overlapping ports not connected, spice line without mut borrow), 
    (during nets prune, for every port ssp, add vertex with unique name if not already exists)

- schematic: 
    ctrl-(shift)-z undo/redo - all commands need to have undo/redo - command trait? what counts as a command?

- designer:
    line segment edit - drag/drop end points
    device saving/loading, device libraries

- circuit:
    - nets/connections:
        connect devices with wire if ports overlap - just add port locations to graph - vertices without neighbors are floating nets - should play well with grab/drag
        wire snapping to ports and visual indicator
        custom net labels
        net highlighting
        pathfinding:
            inconsistent paths - lower priority
            regression tests
            grabbing (moves devices/wire while keeping wire connections)
    draw nets above symbol but below ports
    circuit add device submenu - d to bring up menu, r/v/g to place respective device
    improved parameters editor
    gui toolbar
    consider adding layers trait (devices layer, nets layer, etc.)

- immediate: 
    zooming during device placement visual bug - maybe selection system not a good fit, or just flag phantom devices to not draw?
    
    clean up colors, use iced theme?

- medium term:
    build script to copy ngspice.dll into directory

    logging

    use pane_grid from iced
    
    schematic saving/loading (serde)

    schematic checking - mark floating nets, ports

- long term:
    bypass iced, tesellate with lyon directly
    drawing/stroke culling (maybe?)

    additive/subtractive selection - waiting on better modifiers support
