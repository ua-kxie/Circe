sel: 
    tentatives do not need to be marked, essentially marked by tentative collider

    query for Handle<wire_material>, etc. different for different types. code should reside with that type.

    cant send out events for tentatives marked since tentatives are cleared everytime collider changes
    unless, loop through elements already marked and conditionally unmark, loop through elements not marked and conditionally mark - still need marker component
    - tentatives: use current system

    selected: can use events but why bother right now

    selection by enclosure vs by collision based on selection area sign - create aabbs and test for enclosure

    select single object when multiple are overlapped

    fix persistent sel area if mouse leaves canvas while button pressed
    rethink states:
    sel tool - on exit tool state: clear all tool related entities (sel area)
        point: ray collider, single (with button for cycling) or all
        area: 
            enter on click on canvas
            exit on mouse button release
            on mouse leave canvas: what do? extrapolate? freeze until cursor returns? exit state until mouse returns?
            states:
                point
                area
                area_offcanvas



make into 2d, use bounding area intersections: https://bevyengine.org/examples/2D%20Rendering/bounding-2d/ - wait on 2d render improvements

make selection aabb show different color based on pos/neg area
    draw 2 opposing rects simultaneously with different colors?
    switch color based on selection area - just check for area sign then recreate rect from min/max pts

remove euclid dependency (?)

camera zoom towards cursor

add cursor material
fix sync issue between cursor and wire/selection (events) - cursor uses default material, sel/wire uses custom - submitted issue

selectable/draggable entities (picking plugin?)

make wiring tool draw axis aligned segments only
add wire pruning
make wiring use cursor events
draw wire terminals/solder dots

add device designer
make cursor always appear as same size on screen

gpu instancing for sized grid dots

unify rendering pipelines
