sel: 
    selection by enclosure vs by collision based on selection area sign - create aabbs and test for enclosure
    switch color based on selection area - just check for area sign then recreate rect from min/max pts

    select single object when multiple are overlapped

transform:
    g for grab
    ctrl-c for copy (use buffer? or just c for cadence-like behavior)

    translate

    mirror

    rotate

undo/redo:
    take snapshot of scheamtic elements

wire:
    make wiring tool draw axis aligned segments only
    add wire pruning
    make wiring use cursor events
    draw wire terminals/solder dots

make into 2d, use bounding area intersections: 
https://bevyengine.org/examples/2D%20Rendering/bounding-2d/ - wait on 2d render improvements

camera zoom towards cursor

add cursor material
fix sync issue between cursor and wire/selection (events) - cursor uses default material, sel/wire uses custom - submitted issue

add device designer
make cursor always appear as same size on screen

gpu instancing for sized grid dots

unify rendering pipelines
